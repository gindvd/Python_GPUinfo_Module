**Python module to get the names, and manufacturers, of all connected graphics cards, both dedicated and integrated

## Installation
Download the [source code](https://github.com/gindvd/Python-GPUinfo/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), paste the `GPUinfo` folder into your project directory

## Example
```python
from GPUinfo import *

connected_gpu_manufacturers = manufacturers()

for idx, name in enumerate(connected_gpu_manufacturers):
  print(f"Connected GPU {idx + 1} manufacturered by {name}")

connected_gpu_names = fullnames()

for idx, name in enumerate(connected_gpu_names):
  print(f"GPU {idx + 1}: {name}")
```

## Methods
- **fullnames()**
    
    Returns a list of all connected GPU names:
    ```python
    connected_gpu_names = fullnames()
